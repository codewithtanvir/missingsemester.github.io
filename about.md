<!-- # About Me ✨ -->

Welcome to my blog! My name is **Yakhyo**, and I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

## Background 🎓

I have a background as an ML Software Engineer with ~4 years of industrial and 2+ years of academic experience delivering impactful solutions across various industries. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Gachon University. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences through my writing. I also have a YouTube channel where I share tutorials on programming languages. This blog is a space where I document my thoughts, ideas, and insights on various topics that interest me.

## Interests 🌟

- **Technology:** I love exploring the latest advancements in technology, from software development to artificial intelligence.
- **Books:** Reading is one of my favorite pastimes. I especially enjoy technical books. Some of the books I have read include:
  - _Designing Machine Learning Systems_ by Chip Huyen (2022)
  - _Fluent Python (2nd Edition)_ by Luciano Ramalho (2021)
  - _Deep Learning with PyTorch_ by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann (2020)
  - _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow_ by Aurélien Géron (2017)
  - _Data Structures and Algorithms using Python_ by Rance D. Necaise (2016)
- **Hobbies:** In my free time, I like to solve coding challenges on LeetCode 🧩, contribute to open-source projects 💻, play chess ♟️, go swimming 🏊‍♂️, and go hiking 🥾.

## Motto 🗣️

- Expose yourself to your biggest fear.
- If someone else can do it, you can do it too.
