Tiny-Face is an ultra-lightweight face detection model specifically designed to deliver fast and efficient performance on mobile and edge devices, where computational resources are limited. ðŸš€ Unlike many conventional face detection models, Tiny-Face is streamlined to use minimal memory and processing power while still achieving high precision in detecting faces.

Tiny-Face builds upon the core concepts of RetinaFace but introduces several optimizations that make it ideal for real-world deployment on mobile phones, embedded systems, and IoT devices. With an emphasis on reducing the modelâ€™s footprint, Tiny-Face can run seamlessly on low-power hardware without compromising on detection accuracy, making it an excellent choice for applications where speed and efficiency are critical.
