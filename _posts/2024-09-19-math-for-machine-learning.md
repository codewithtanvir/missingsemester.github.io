I have a strong background in mathematics, particularly in calculus from high school, and I can confidently perform various matrix multiplications and operations by hand. This has given me a solid understanding of vectors from both mathematical and computer science perspectives.

However, I wasn't fully aware of their geometric implications until recently. As I began exploring geometric explanations, I started perceiving lists, arrays, and embeddings as something pointing to a specific point in space. ðŸŒŒ

Understanding the geometric perspective of vectors allows us to approach problems through the lens of geometry, deepening our comprehension of the underlying mathematics in machine learning. I highly recommend that anyone interested in machine learning, but not yet familiar with its geometric implications, explore the following courses:

- Essence of Linear Algebra ðŸ“Š - [course link](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra)
- Mathematics for Machine Learning:
  - Linear Algebra âž— - [course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning)
  - Multivariate Calculus ðŸ“ˆ - [course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ðŸ“‰ - [course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning)

I believe that investing time in this could potentially change the way you think. ðŸ’¡
